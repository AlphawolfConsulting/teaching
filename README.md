# Welcome to the teaching repo for Alphawolf Consulting
So, why are you here? Well, clearly someone sent you a link saying you should look at this repo to see what the heckle peckle we are doing.

## Ground rules
This is a public repo for "musings" and "trails". As such, we do not claim that the information on here is right, good, correct, etc. It is just thoughts about the different topics that we are wandering through.

## AWS
We have made the conscience decision to go with AWS as our cloud platform of choice. While we like the Azure stuff, we simply find that we have a better relationship with AWS and so have been focusing more on it. As such, we have created a practice within the company that is AWS specific. So, if you are wondering why no DO (digitalocean), Azure, RackSpace, etc., it is because we are moving to being experts in AWS.

## Functional Programming
Okay, here is the caveat about religion. This is ours :) We will not be getting faster cores, we will be getting more cores; many, many, many more cores. As such, you should, dare I say need, to switch to immutable variables and pure functions. For us that means https://elixir-lang.org, https://elm-lang.org, https://www.erlang.org, and https://nodejs.org

# Projects
## GIS
This is where we will have our GIS based stuff listed

## Node
This is where our node based stuff will be listed

## Blockchain
This is where our blockchain stuff is listed. To be honest, it will actually all be Etherium stuff with regards to code cause we have decided the confirmation times will kill Bitcoin for smart contracts ... so we are betting on Ether to be the coin of the realm.

## Postgres
We love Postgres. We are all in on Postgres ... we love RDS Postgres ... We are starting to love Aurora Postgres. So, this is where we have our musings on all things Postgres ... from jsonb stuff to lambda based ETL.

## Lambda
This is as the name implies our Lambda function space

## Elixir
All stuff Elixir is here

## Erlang
Yup, our Erlang thoughts

## Elm
We are comming around to Elm. We love the no runtime errors aspect of it. The pure functions help a ton too.

## Other
Well we always need a catch all bucket, so here it is.
